# Package: daq-midas
# Architecture: any
# Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
# Description: MIDAS DAQ software suite
#  Midas is a versatile Data acquisition System for medium scale physics
#  experiments. Midas is a result of a development effort made by Stefan Ritt at
#  PSI/Switzerland (Midas@PSI) in collaboration with the members of the Data
#  acquisition group at Triumf/Canada.
#  .
#  The main purpose of the MIDAS DAQ is to provide:
#  * data collection from local and/or remote hardware source.
#  * data recording to common storage media.
#  * Full data flow control.
#  .
#  This is a virtual package provided by 'daq-midas-root' or 'daq-midas-noroot'.
